To capture the scale of suffering, we created an interactive article with pictures of these families and snippets of their experiences. Centered in this was a gallery of faces, which revealed their stories on hover.","role":"Design, development, automated email requests, data collection and management.","tech":"R, gmail API, scrollama, vanilla-lazyload","link":"http://projects.nj.com/unemployment/","image":"uau.jpg"},{"title":"24 Hours in Crisis","description":"During the peak of the coronavirus pandemic in New Jersey, more than three dozen journalists from NJ Advance Media set out to create the most comprehensive documentation of this crisis in the state. The unique challenge here was to capture one day in the lives of 9 million residents and go to publication right after. We accomplished this by setting up four standard design patterns which were then used for each snippet of experience captured by a reporter. These snippets were then arranged in chronological order to create a cohesive picture of what living through that day was like.","role":"Design, development","tech":"Custom lazyloader using intersection observer, scrollama","link":"https://projects.nj.com/24hours/","image":"24hic.jpg"},{"title":"BoidGL: A WebGL experiment with Boids","description":"A self-instruction project turned immersive experience.

We designed a platform for those businesses to post modified hours, services and latest information. Centralized in these posts are quotes from business owners to make them personable and help connect with customers. These can be filtered by county, town and business type for residents looking for a specific service in their area.","role":"Design, development, data pipeline for hourly updates","tech":"shufflejs, selectize, aws lambda, node.js","link":"https://projects.nj.com/open/","image":"njio.jpg"},{"title":"The Aftermath of a YouTube Apology ft. <svg width=\"150px\" style=\"enable-background:new 0 0 192.6 50;\" xml:space=\"preserve\" viewBox=\"0 0 192.6 50\"><g><path class=\"st0\" d=\"M150.1,9.5c1.5,0,2.8,1.3,2.8,2.8s-1.3,2.8-2.8,2.8s-2.8-1.3-2.8-2.8S148.6,9.5,150.1,9.5z\"></path><path class=\"st0\" d=\"M147.2,17.3h5.6v18.2h-5.6V17.3z\"></path><path class=\"st0\" d=\"M77.1,9.5h-1.9h-7v19.3v6.7h5.6v-6.7v-1.4h1.4h1.9c4.9,0,8.9-4,8.9-8.9S82.1,9.5,77.1,9.5z M77.1,21.8h-1.9 h-1.4v-1.4v-3.8v-1.4h1.4h1.9c1.8,0,3.3,1.5,3.3,3.3S79,21.8,77.1,21.8z\"></path><path class=\"st0\" d=\"M105.7,17.6h-5.6v8.9c0,1.8-1.5,3.3-3.3,3.3s-3.3-1.5-3.3-3.3v-8.9h-5.6v8.9c0,4.9,4,8.9,8.9,8.9 s8.9-4,8.9-8.9V17.6z\"></path><path class=\"st0\" d=\"M164.1,17.6c-4.9,0-8.9,4-8.9,8.9v8.9h5.6v-8.9c0-1.8,1.5-3.3,3.3-3.3s3.3,1.5,3.3,3.3v8.9h5.6v-8.9 C173,21.6,169,17.6,164.1,17.6z\"></path><path class=\"st0\" d=\"M119.7,16.2v1.4h-1.4h-1.9c-4.9,0-8.9,4-8.9,8.9s4,8.9,8.9,8.9h1.9h7V16.2V9.5l-5.6,3.3 C119.7,12.8,119.7,16.2,119.7,16.2z M119.8,24.6v3.8v1.4h-1.4h-1.9c-1.8,0-3.3-1.5-3.3-3.3s1.5-3.3,3.3-3.3h1.9h1.4V24.6z\"></path><path class=\"st0\" d=\"M139.3,16.2v1.4h-1.4H136c-4.9,0-8.9,4-8.9,8.9s4,8.9,8.9,8.9h1.9h7V16.2V9.5l-5.6,3.3V16.2z M139.4,24.6v3.8 v1.4h-1.5H136c-1.8,0-3.3-1.5-3.3-3.3s1.5-3.3,3.3-3.3h1.9h1.4v1.4H139.4z\"></path><path class=\"st0\" d=\"M183.7,17.6c-4.9,0-8.9,4-8.9,8.9s4,8.9,8.9,8.9h1.9h1.4v1.4v0.9v1.4v1.4c0,1.8-1.5,3.3-3.3,3.3 s-3.3-1.5-3.3-3.3V38l-5.6,3.3c0.4,4.5,4.2,8.1,8.9,8.1c4.9,0,8.9-4,8.9-8.9v-1.4v-2.3V17.6h-7H183.7z M187,23.4v1.4v3.8V30h-1.4 h-1.9c-1.8,0-3.3-1.5-3.3-3.3s1.5-3.3,3.3-3.3h1.9C185.6,23.4,187,23.4,187,23.4z\"></path><path class=\"st0\" d=\"M28.6,17.6c-1.2,0-2.3,0.2-3.3,0.6V9.5l-5.6,3.3v13.7v2v6.9h5.6v-6.9l0,0v-2c0-1.8,1.5-3.3,3.3-3.3 s3.3,1.5,3.3,3.3v8.9h5.6v-8.9C37.5,21.6,33.5,17.6,28.6,17.6z\"></path><path class=\"st0\" d=\"M17.8,9.5H0v5.6h6.1v20.3h5.6V15.1h6.1V9.5z\"></path><path class=\"st0\" d=\"M48.3,30.2c-0.4,0-1.2-0.1-1.8-0.4l5.2-2.1l5.6-2.3l-1-2.3l-0.1-0.2c-0.1-0.3-0.3-0.6-0.5-1 c-0.1-0.1-0.1-0.2-0.2-0.3c0,0,0-0.1-0.1-0.1l-0.1-0.1l-0.1-0.1c-1.6-2.2-4-3.5-6.7-3.7l0,0h-0.6c-4.9,0-8.9,4-8.9,8.9 c0,0.4,0,0.9,0.1,1.4l0,0V28c0,0,0,0,0,0.1c0,0,0,0,0,0.1c0,0.3,0.1,0.5,0.2,0.8v0.1v0.1c0.1,0.3,0.2,0.7,0.4,1v0.1v0.1 c0.1,0.3,0.3,0.5,0.4,0.8c0,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.2l0,0c0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.4,0.6c0,0,0,0,0,0.1c0,0,0,0.1,0.1,0.1l0.1,0.1 c1.7,2.1,4.4,3.4,7.2,3.4h6.1v-5.2C54.5,30.2,50.6,30.2,48.3,30.2L48.3,30.2z M56.2,22.9L56.2,22.9L56.2,22.9z M44.6,25.7 L44.6,25.7l-0.2,0.1c0.2-1.9,1.8-3.5,3.7-3.5c0.9,0,1.8,0.4,2.4,0.9L46.2,25L44.6,25.7L44.6,25.7z\"></path></g></svg>","description":"The YouTube apology video is now its own genre.

Some communities have a lot of immigrant businesses while others have industries with a lot of immigrant workers. How do we understand these contributions nationally, given this local context? We set out to answer this question by creating an index of economic contribution composed of features like rate of business ownership, tax contributions and workforce share in major industries. What emerged was an incredible picture of America with a huge variation in immigrant utilization and change in that utilization over time and space.","role":"Design, development, data analysis","tech":"R, d3.js, scrollama","link":"https://arjunkakkar8.github.io/mapping-immigrant-impact/","image":"mii.jpg"},{"title":"Reimagining Institutional Diversity: Williams College","description":"The classic picture of diversity in universities is based in proportional representation. Even though a good start, this picture completely misses representation in interactions, spaces of power and academic fields. As students at Williams College we tried to reimagine this metric of proportional representation at the college level. By looking at where students were choosing to live, we could start understanding the social dynamics at the school and quantify the very personal choices of who students choose to live with. Comparing where students of different races were living to a random allocation of housing, we found a strong degree of racial separation in particular dorms at the school. This was then presented in an interactive guided story to highlight these massive disparities to the administration.","role":"Design, development, data collection and analysis","tech":"R, d3.js, scrollama","link":"https://arjunkakkar8.github.io/williams-diversity-website/","image":"wdp.jpg"}]}
