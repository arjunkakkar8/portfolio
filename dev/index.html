		      <div class="project-description">
		        <p>During the peak of the coronavirus pandemic in New Jersey, more than three dozen journalists from NJ Advance Media set out to create the most comprehensive documentation of this crisis in the state. The unique challenge here was to capture one day in the lives of 9 million residents and go to publication within a couple of days. We accomplished this by setting up four standard design patterns which were then used for each snippet of experience captured by a reporter. They were then arranged in chronological order to create a cohesive picture of what living through that day would be like.</p>

		      </h3>
		      <div class="project-description">
		        <p>What does the local economic impact of immigrants look like across the US? Some communities have a lot of immigrant businesses while others have industries with a lot of immigrant workers. How do we understand these contributions nationally, given this local context? We set out to answer this question by creating an index of economic contribution composed of features like rate of business ownership, tax contributions and workforce share in major industries. What emerged was an incredible picture of America with a huge variation in immigrant utilization and change in that utilization over time and space.</p>

		          Reimagining Institutional Diversity: Williams College

		      </h3>
		      <div class="project-description">
		        <p>The classic picture of diversity in universities is based in proportional representation. Even though a good start, this picture completely misses representation in interactions, spaces of power and academic fields. As students at Williams College we tried to reimagine this metric of proportional representation at the college level. By looking at where students were choosing to live, we could start understanding the social dynamics at the school and quantify the very personal choices of who students choose to live with. Comparing where students of different races were living to a random allocation of housing, we found a strong degree of racial separation in particular dorms at the school. This was then presented in an interactive guided story to highlight these massive disparities to the administration.</p>
